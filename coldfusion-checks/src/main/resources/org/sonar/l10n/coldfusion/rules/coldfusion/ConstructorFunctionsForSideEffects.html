<p>
Some people like to call constructor functions without assigning its result to any variable.
There is no advantage in this approach over simply calling constructor function since the object that the operator new creates isn't used anywhere.
So such kind of syntax is misleading and should be avoided.

The following code snippet illustrates this rule :
</p>

<pre>
var something = new MyConstructor();  // Compliant
new MyConstructor(); // Non-Compliant
</pre>
