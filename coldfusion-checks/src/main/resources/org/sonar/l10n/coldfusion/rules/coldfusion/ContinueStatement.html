<p>
The use of the 'continue' branching statement increase the essential complexity of the source code
and so prevent any refactoring of this source code to replace all well structured control structures with a single statement.
</p>

<p>
For instance, in the following program fragment, it's not possible to apply the 'extract method' refactoring pattern :
</p>

<pre>
mylabel: for (i = 0 ; i < 3; i++) {
  for (j = 0; j < 4 ; j++) {
    doSomething();
    if (checkSomething()) {
      continue mylabel; // Non-Compliant
    }
  }
}
</pre>
