<p>
Octal numbers should be avoided because the syntax to declare them (prefix by zero) makes it ambiguous for novice ColdFusion developers to understand the real value of the number.
For instance, the octal "0644" number actually equals to 420, not 644.
</p>

<p>
What's more, even if all browsers support it, this syntax is not part of CF and will generate an error in ColdFusion strict mode code.

The following code snippet illustrates this rule :
</p>

<pre>
var i = 0644; // Non-Compliant
var j = 420; // Compliant
</pre>
