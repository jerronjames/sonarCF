<p>
Overriding a variable declared in an outer scope might highly impact the readability and so maintainability of a piece of code.
</p>

<p>
The following code snippet illustrates this rule :
</p>
<pre>
show: function(point, element) {
  if (!this.drops.length) return;
  var drop, affected = [];
  this.drops.each( function(drop) { // Non-Compliant as the 'drop' parameter is not the one defined one line before even if it looks like
    if(Droppables.isAffected(point, element, drop))
      affected.push(drop);
  });
  ...
</pre>
