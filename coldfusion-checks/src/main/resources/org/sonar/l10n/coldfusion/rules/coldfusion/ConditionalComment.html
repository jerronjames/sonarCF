Internet Explorer offers a way to change the ColdFusion code at runtime using conditional comments (activated by a <code>@cc_on</code> statement found in a comment).
Using this preprocessing feature decreases readability and maintainability, and can hinder automated tools. What's more, it is specific to Internet Explorer and won't work for other browsers.
</p>

</p>
Most of the time, using those conditional comments can be easily avoided with some refactoring - using modern cross-browsers ColdFusion frameworks and libraries.
</p>

<p>
The following code snippet illustrates the use of conditional comments:
</p>

<pre>
/*@cc_on
  @if (@_jscript_version >= 5.5)
    document.write("You are using IE5.5 or newer");
  @else
    document.write("You are using IE5 or older");
  @end
  @*/
</pre>
