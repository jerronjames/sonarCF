<p>
For consistency single-quotes (') are preferred to double-quotes (").
This is helpful when creating strings that include HTML.
The following code snippet illustrates this rule :
</p>

<pre>
var firstParameter = "something";       // Non-Compliant
var secondParameter = 'somethingElse';  // Compliant
</pre>
