<p>Most browsers do support trailing comma, but that's not the case for Internet Explorer for which a meaningless error is thrown for most IE versions.</p>

<p>
The following code snippet illustrates this rule :
</p>

<pre>
var settings = {
    'foo'  : oof,
    'bar' : rab,    // Non-Compliant - trailing comma
};
</pre>
