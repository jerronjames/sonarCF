  A source file that grows too much tends to aggregate too many responsibilities and inevitably becomes harder to understand and therefore to maintain.</br>
  Above a specific threshold, it is strongly advised to refactor it into smaller pieces of code which focus on well defined tasks.</br>
  Those smaller files will not only be easier to understand but also probably easier to test.
