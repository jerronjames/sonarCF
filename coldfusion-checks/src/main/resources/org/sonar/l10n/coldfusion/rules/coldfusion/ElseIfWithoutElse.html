<p>
This rule applies whenever an if statement is followed by one or more else if statements; the final else if shall be followed by an else statement.
In the case of a simple if statement then the else statement need not be included.
The requirement for a final else statement is defensive programming.
The else statement should either take appropriate action or contain a suitable comment as to why no action is taken.
This is consistent with the requirement to have a final default clause in a switch statement.

The following code snippet illustrates this rule:
</p>

<pre>
int x = 0;

// This "if" statement is fine, since it has no "else if" clause, no "else" is required
if (x == 0) {
  x = 42;
}

// This "if" statement is also fine
if (x == 0) {
  x = 42;
} else {
  x = -42;
}

// This "if" statement is bad, because it has an "else if" but no "else" clause
if (x == 0) {
  x = 42;
} else if (x == 1) {
  x = -42;
} else if (x == 2) { // Non-Compliant
  x = 0;
}
</pre>
