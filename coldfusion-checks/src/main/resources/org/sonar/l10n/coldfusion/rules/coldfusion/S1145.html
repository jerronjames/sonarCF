<p>
  If statements with conditions that are always false have the effect of making blocks of code non-functional. This can be useful during debugging, but should not be checked in. If statements with conditions that are always true are completely redundant, and make the code less readable.
</p>
<p>
  In either case, non-conditional if statements should be removed.

<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
if (true) {
  doSomething();
}
...
if (false) {
  doSomethingElse();
}
</pre>

<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
doSomething();
...
</pre>
